A website about Michigan breweries


There are currently over one hundred different breweries in the state of Michigan. My website is based on some of the popular microbreweries in the area. Beers from Michigan that are likely to be found at the local grocery store. My website will be an introduction and guide to the craft beer movement in Michigan and include popular breweries across the state worth checking out. My target audience is anyone over the age of 21 that is interested in learning more about the Michigan craft beer movement.
The design of the website is mimics what you would see at a typical brewpub that sells and brews craft beers. The background image is made up of brick. The content of the page and page navigation is made to look like a chalkboard. The chalkboard is very common in craft beer bars. The selections of what is available often change throughout the season, and what is currently available is usually displayed on a large chalkboard within the bar.
